# Miniblink-Python-SimpleDemo

A very simple Miniblink and Python 3 binding example. Sketchy and rough  prototype as it is, it might, someday in the future, become a not bad candidate to get a quick view of Miniblink.

To run the demo: 

1. Download a [Miniblink](https://github.com/weolar/miniblink49) pre-complied binary release (SDK) If you haven't had a copy of that yet.  [Here (Miniblink releases)](https://github.com/weolar/miniblink49/releases), you may find the download links (pan.baidu.com) of the Miniblink binary compressed release (SDK, ~21MB).
2. Extract either all files or only `node.dll` from the downloaded release compressed file and place them/it in the same folder of `main.py`.
3. Run `pythonw main.py` or `python main.py`.
